\chapter{Proof of Equivalence}

In the past chapter we've modeled a flat synchronized P system as a PTI-net; 
notice that there is now not a bijection corrispondence between objects in the P system and places in the net as with basic P systems.
We need a new operator.

\begin{definition}[$\psi$ operator]
We define a function $\psi: M \rightarrow M$ that takes a multiset M and returns a subset of it 
that contains only the places $p=(a)$.
\end{definition}

The definition \hyperref[def:map_conf]{$3.1.2$} remains valid.

\begin{definition}[mapping rules]
... una volta fatto questo dovrebbe essere finito
\end{definition}

\begin{fact}[]
$v(C_0)=\psi(M_{0})$
\end{fact}
