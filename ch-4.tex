\chapter{Traduction}

In this chapter we make our proposal on how P system can be interpreted by Petri nets, starting from the interpretation of a basic P system.

\section{From Basic P Systems to Petri Nets}
\label{sec:basic_p_to_pt}

To model a flat P system as a PT-net we take inspiration from \cite{kleijn2008petri}, so we introduce a separate place $(a)$ for each object $a$. 
For each evolution rule $r$ we introduce a separate transition $t^r$.
If the transformation described by a rule $r$ consumes $k$ copies of an object $a$, then we introduce a $k$-weighted arc from place $(a)$ to transition $t^r$, and similarly for molecules being produced.
Finally, assuming that, initially, the P system contains $n$ copies of object $a$, we introduce $n$ tokens into place $(a)$.
We formalise this idea as follows.

\begin{definition}[translating flat P systems into PT-nets]
\label{def:def_tr_basic}
The PT-net corresponding to $\Pi$ is:
\[ N_\Pi = (P,T,W,M_0) \]
where:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $P=V$ and $M_0(p)=w(a)$ for every place $p=(a)$;
    \item $T$ consists of distinct transitions $t=t^r$ for every evolution rule $r \in R$;
    \item for each place $p=(a)$ the weight of the incoming arc is $W(p,t)=lhs^r(a)$ and 
    $W(t,p)=rhs^r(a)$
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

To capture the correspondence between the P system $\Pi$ and the PT-net $N_\Pi$, we introduce a straightforward bijection between configurations of $\Pi$ and markings of $N_\Pi$, based on the correspondence of objects and places as well as that of vector multi-rules and steps.

\begin{definition}[mapping configurations]
\label{def:map_conf}
The marking $v(C)$ corresponding to configuration $C=(w)$ is defined by $v(C)(a)=w(a)$ for every place $(a)$.   
$\beta(r_m)$, where $r_m$ is a multiset of rules over $R$, is defined by 
$\beta(r_m)(t^r)=r_m(r)$ for every transition $t^r$.  
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[mapping vector multi-rules]
$\beta(r_m)$, where $r_m$ is a multiset of rules over $R$, is defined by 
$\beta(r_m)(t^r)=r_m(r)$ for every transition $t^r$.  
\end{definition}

\begin{fact}[]
$v(C_0)=M_0$
\end{fact}
We know that's true for the way we've defined $M_0$ in \hyperref[def:def_tr_basic]{$3.1.1$}.

\begin{fact}[]
$C \xRightarrow{r_m} C'$ if and only if $v(C)[\beta(r_m)> v(C')$ in $N_\Pi$
\end{fact}

Togheter with Fact 3.1.1, this implies that the computations of $\Pi$ coincide with step sequences of $N_\Pi$. 

\section{From Synchronized P Sytems to PTI-nets}

Here we extend the modus operandi of the section \hyperref[sec:basic_p_to_pt]{$3.1$} to translate 
a flat synchronized P system.
For each synchronization rule $r_s$ (see \hyperref[def:sync_rule]{$2.2.4$}) we introduce a new transition $t^s$ (we call these \textit{synchronization transitions}) and for each object $a \in V$ we introduce a new place $(a,d)$ where $d$ stands for deposit (we call them deposit places).
We keep the arcs from places $(a)$ to transitions $t^r$, but substitute the arcs from $t^r$ to $(a)$ with arcs from $t^r$ to $(a,d)$.
Each synchronization transition is paired with two new control places $(s,1)$ and $(s,2)$ and a new transition $t^{s\prime}$.
We do a zero-check in the places $(s,1)$ to verify if the relative sync transitions were part of the previous step.
PT-nets are not expressive enough to model the absence of token in a place, so we need to use PT-nets extended with inhibitor arcs.
Below a more formal definition.

\begin{definition}[Translating Synchronized P systems into PTI-nets]
The PTI-net corresponding to $\Pi$ is 
\[ N_\Pi = (P,T,W,I,M_0) \]
,where:

\begin{enumerate}
  
  \item We define the set $P$ as follows:
  \begin{enumerate}
     \item for each $a \in V$, there exists a place $(a)$ and a place $(a,d)$, and 
     $M_0(p)=w(a)$ for each place $p=(a)$ and $M_0(p)=0$ for each place $p=(a,d)$;
     \item for each $r_s \in \rho$, there exists a place $(s,1)$ and a place $(s,2)$;
     $M_0(p)=1$ for each place $(s,1)$ and $M_0(p)=0$ for each place $(s,2)$
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item $T$ consists of distinct transitions $t=t^r$ for every evolution rule $r \in R$, and 
    distinct transitions $t=t^s$ for every synchronization rule $r_s \in \rho$;
    for each $t^s$ in $T$ there exists one control transitions $t=t^{s'}$;
    
    \item We define the function $W$ as follows:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item for each place $p=(a)$, $W(p,t^r)=lhs^r(a)$, $W(p,t^s)=\sum_{r \in rs} rs(r)lhs^r(a)$, $W(t^r,p)=0$ and $W(t^s,p)=0$;
        \item for each deposit place $p=(a,d)$, $W(p,t^r)=0$ and $W(p,t^s)=0$, $W(t^r,p)=rhs^r(a)$ and $W(t^s,p)=\sum_{r \in rs} rs(r)rhs^r(a)$;
        \item for each place $p=(s,1)$, $W(p,t^s)=1$, $W(t^{s'},p)=1$ and for each place $p=(s,2)$, $W(t^s,p)=1$,$W(p,t^{s'})=1$ ;
    \end{enumerate}

    \item We define the relation $I$ as follows:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item for each place $p=(s,1)$, and for each transition $t^r$, where $r \in r_s$, 
        $(p,t^r) \in I$;
    \end{enumerate}
    
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

Once there are no more transitions that can be fired, all tokens in $p=(a,d)$ are moved in the place $p=(a)$ for each $a \in V$. So there is a ghost step that indicates the end of a computation of the P system. 
We indicate this ghost step as $\gamma$.

\section{Semantic of our PTI net}

In this section we recall the definition of step semantics for PT nets from \cite{vogler1992partial} but we extend the definition with the presence of inhibitor arcs.

\begin{definition}[Step]
    Let $N=(P,T,W,I,M)$ be a PTI-net.
    A multiset of transition $\mathcal{T}$, called step, is enabled to occur in a marking 
    $M$ of $N$ iff:
    
    \[ \forall p \in P : M(p) \geq \sum_{t \in T} W(p,t) \cdot \mathcal{T}(t)  \text{ and }
    (p,t) \in I \rightarrow M(p)=0 \]

    If a step $\mathcal{T}$ is enabled to occur in a marking $M$, then its occurence leads to the new marking $M'$ defined by:
    \[ \forall p \in P : M'(p)=M(p)+\sum_{t \in T} W(t,p) - W(p,t)) \cdot \mathcal{T}(t) \]

    We write $M \xrightarrow{\mathcal{T}} M'$ to denote that $\mathcal{T}$ is enabled to occur in 
    $M$ and that its occurrence leads to $M'$.
\end{definition}

Our new PTI semantics is a \textit{non maximal semantics}.
It means that if $\mathcal{T}$ is enabled in a marking $M$, then could exists a transition $t$ such that $M[\mathcal{T} \cup \{t\}\rangle$.

\begin{definition}[Step sequence]
    A finite sequence of steps (step sequence) $\sigma = \mathcal{T}_1 \dots \mathcal{T}_n$, is called a step sequence enabled in $M$ and leading to $M_n$ if there exists a sequence of markings $M_1, \ldots , M_n$, such that
    \[ M \xrightarrow{\mathcal{T}_1} M_1 \xrightarrow{\mathcal{T}_2} \cdots \xrightarrow{\mathcal{T}_n} M_n\]

    So we say that a marking $M'$ is reachable from the marking $M$ if and only if there exists a steps sequence enabled in $M$ and leading to $M'$.
\end{definition}
