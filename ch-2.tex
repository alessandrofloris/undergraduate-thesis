\chapter{Background}

In this chapter we introduce some general notions as well as a more deep understanding of what P systems and Petri nets are.

\section{Basic Definitions}

\begin{definition}[Multiset]
Let $U$ be an arbitrary set. A multiset over U is a mapping \newline $m : U \rightarrow N$.
The multiplicity of an element $u$ in $m$ is given by the natural number $m(u)$.
\end{definition}

The operator $\oplus$ denotes multiset union: $m \oplus m' = m(u) + m'(u)$ for each $u$.

\begin{definition}[Alphabet]
An alphabet is a finite nonempty set of abstract symbols. Given an alphabet $V$, we denote by $V^*$
the sets of all finite strings of elements in $V$, including the empty string $\lambda$.
Every string $v \in V$ describes a multiset over $V$.
\end{definition}

\section{P Systems}

Membrane computing is a branch of natural computing, introduced by Gheorghe Paun with the definition of P systems in \cite{puaun2000computing,puaun2002membrane,paun1999computing}.

Membrane systems are based upon the notion of \textit{membrane structure}, which is a structure composed by several cell-membranes, hierarchically embedded in a main membrane called the \textit{skin membrane}.
The membranes delimit \textit{regions} and we associate with each region a set of \textit{objects}, described by some symbols over an alphabet, and a set of \textit{evolution rules}.
In the basic variant, the objects evolve according to the evolution rules, which can modify the objects to obtain new objects.
The evolution rules are applied in a maximally parallel manner: at each step, all the objects which can evolve should evolve.
If a computation \textit{halts}, so no further evolution rule can be applied, the result of the computation is defined to be the number of objects in a specified membrane.

\begin{definition}[P system]
A P system (of degree $d$, with $d \geq 1$) is a tuple
\[ \Pi = (V,\mu,w^0_1,...,w^0_d,R_1,...,R_d, i_0)\]
where:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $V$ is an alphabet; its elements are called objects;
  \item $\mu$ is a membrane structure consisting of $d$ membranes (labeled with $1,2,...,d$);
  \item $w^0_1, 1 \leq i \leq d$, are strings from $V^*$ representing multisets over $V$ associated
  with the regions $1,2,...,d$ of $\mu$;
  \item $R_i, 1 \leq i \leq d$, are finite sets of evolution rules over $V$ associated 
  with the regions $1,2,...,d$ of $\mu$; these evolution rules are of the form $u \rightarrow v$,
  where $u$ and $v$ are strings from $V*$;
  \item $i_0$ is a number between 1 and $d$ which specifies the output membrane of %\Pi;
\end{enumerate}
A configuration of $\Pi$ is a tuple $C=(w_1,...,w_d)$ of multisets of objects, and 
$C_0=(w^0_1,...,w^0_d)$ is the initial configuration.
\end{definition}

According to \cite{agrigoroaiei2010flattening}, any P system can be flattened to a system of degree 1, we call this type of P systems \textit{flat P systems}.
For the sake of simplicity, from now on when we talk about P systems we refer to flat P systems.

\begin{definition}[Flat P system]
A flat P system is a P system of degree one
\[ \Pi = (V,\mu,w^0,R) \]

Given the fact that we're working with a one degree system we removed the subscript from $w$ and $R$. 
A configuration of $\Pi$ is a singleton $C=(w)=w$ of a multiset of objects, and 
$C_0=(w^0)=w^0$ is the initial configuration.
\end{definition}

The following example will clarify the definition of a P system.
\begin{example}
\label{ex:flat_membrane}
Consider the system of degree 1:
\begin{description}
   \item $\Pi=(V,\mu,w^0,R)$,
   \item $V=\{a,b,c\}$,
   \item $\mu=[_{1}]_{1}$,
   \item $C_0=w^0=a^2b$,
   \item $R=\{r_1:a \rightarrow b, r_2:a \rightarrow c\}$
\end{description}    
\end{example}

The system is represented in Fig 2.1.

\begin{figure}[h]

\begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw[thick, rounded corners=10pt] (0, 0) rectangle (4, 2.5) node[above right] {1};
    
    \node at (2, 1.75) {$a^2b$};
    \node at (2,1.25) (rule) {$r1: a \rightarrow b$};
    \node at (2,0.75) (rule) {$r2: a \rightarrow c$};
\end{tikzpicture}

\caption{}
\label{}
\end{figure}

The possibilities to evolve in one step from the initial configuration are: 
\begin{description}
    \item $C=w=b^3$, obtained applying $r=r_1^2$,
    \item $C=w=bc^2$, obtained applying $r=r_2^2$,
    \item $C=w=b^2c$, obtained applying $r=r_1 r_2$
\end{description}

\subsection{Synchronized P systems}

In this section we introduce a new class of P systems, P systems with \textit{synchronization among the rules of the same membrane}.
In the previous section we've seen a kind of synchronization where all regions use their rules in parallel in the maximal mode.
That synchronization that we're interested in is different, more exactly, a rule synchronizing with a non-empty set of rules is applicable at least once only if each rule from the set of rules is applicable at least once.

We call P systems with this kind of synchronization \textit{synchronized P systems}.
They are introduced and studied in \cite{aman2019synchronization,aman2022power}.

\begin{definition}[Synchronized P system]
A synchronized P system is a tuple

\[ \Pi = (V,\mu,w^0,R,\rho) \]

where:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $(V,\mu,w^0,r)$ is a flat P system;    
    \item $\rho$ is a partial relation defined over the set $R$ of rules specifying
    the synchronization relation over the rules;
    $\rho$ is irreflexive, asymmetric and transitive;
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

% Questa parte Ã¨ da cancellare e riscrivere 
Let's try to understand better what synchronization means:
let $(r1,r2) \in \rho$; if $r1$ is executed at least one time, then also
$r2$ has to be executed at least one time during this step, and vice versa; if that is not possible neither of them will be executed during the current step.

We use the following notation to describe an instance of $\rho$: 
$\rho=((r1 \otimes r2),(r3 \otimes r4 \otimes r5))$.
This means that $r_1$ can be executed only and only if $r_2$ can be executed at least one time;
in addition, $r_1$ it's executed at least one time only and only if also $r_2$ it's executed at least one time.

\begin{definition}[synchronization rule]
\label{def:sync_rule}
We define a synchronization rule $r_s$ as a set of rules.\\
For example $r_s=r_1 r_2 = r_1 \otimes r_2$ could be a synchronization rule.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
    We modify \hyperref[ex:flat_membrane]{$example 1$} adding the synchronization 
    $r_1 \otimes r_2$.\\
    Now there is only one possible way to evolve in one step from the initial configuration:\\
    $C=w=b^2c$, obtained applying $r=r_1 r_2=r_1 \otimes r_2=r_{12}$;
\end{example}

In this previous example we have illustrated how the maximal parallelism behaviour is modified when synchronization of rules is used.

\section{Semantics of Synchronized P Systems}

For the purpose of this thesis it is useful to define a new semantics for our synchronized P systems.
We know that a rule $r$ which is part of a synchronization rule $r_s$ can be executed if and only $r_s$ it's executed during the same computational step. 
So we could say that the application of the rule $r$ causally depends on the application of the synchronization rule $r_s$.\newline

Let's say that a computational step is an ordered sequence of micro steps obtained by the application of a single evolution rule.
So now a classical maximal parallelism evolution step is represented as a sequence of simple evolution steps.
This is a \textit{causal semantics}, and was first defined for a basic P system in \cite{busi2007causality}.\newline

\begin{definition}[configuration and partial configuration]
    In our new semantics a configuration is a pair $C=(w_1,w_2)$ where $w_1$ is the active multiset and $w_2$ is the deposit (or frozen) multiset.\newline
    We call a configuration $C=(w_1,w_2)$ where $w_2 \neq \emptyset$ a \textit{partial configuration}; if $w_2 = \emptyset$ we'll refer to $C$ as a configuration.
\end{definition}

So now the initial configuration is $C_0=(w_1,\emptyset)$.
Doing a whole computational step means to go from a configuration $(w_1,\emptyset)$ to another configuration $(w_1',\emptyset)$ passing throw a sequence of micro steps.

Before providing the definition of a computational step and of micro steps, we need a new auxiliary definition.
We introduce a new function, the \textit{transport function}, that transports the objects in the deposit multiset to the active multiset.

\begin{definition}[transport function]
    Let $C=(w,w')$ be a partial configuration of $\Pi$.\newline
    The transport function $\delta: Conf_\Pi \rightarrow Conf_\Pi$ is defined as follows:\newline
    $\delta((w,w'))=(w \oplus w', \emptyset)$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[computational step and micro steps]
    A computational step is defined as an ordered sequence of micro steps.\newline
    $(w_1,\emptyset) \Rightarrow (w_1',\emptyset)$ is a computational step if and only if 
    there exists $k$ micro steps such that $(w_1,\emptyset) \xrightarrow{r_1} (w_1'',w_2'')
    \xrightarrow{r_2} \cdots \xrightarrow{r_k} (w_1',\emptyset)$ where $r_k$ is the transport function $\delta$.
    We also define $r=<r_1,\ldots,r_k>$ as the ordered sequence of evolution rules applied at each micro step.
\end{definition}

Now we describe how our semantics works with the following inference rules:\newline

\noindent
\begin{tabular}{ @{} r c l @{} }
  R1. & \infer{(w,w') \xrightarrow{\delta} (w \oplus w', \emptyset) }
{\text{no rule is applicable}} \\ \\
  R2. & \infer{(w,w') \xrightarrow{r_s} (w - lhs(r_s), w' + rhs(r_s)) }
{\text{$r_s$ is enabled in $(w,w')$}} \\ \\
  R3. & \infer{(w,w') \xrightarrow{r} (w - lhs(r_s), w' + rhs(r_s)) }
{\text{$r$ is enabled in $(w,w')$ and if $r$ is part of $r_s$, $r_s$ has been executed}} \\ \\
\end{tabular}

Let's see an example of our new semantics.
\begin{example}
    Consider the system 
    \[ \Pi = (\{a,b,c,d\},[_1]_1,a^2bc,\{r_1:a \rightarrow b, r_2: b \rightarrow c\}, \{r_{s1}: r_1 r_2\}) \]
    The only rule we can apply is R2, since $r_{s1}$ is enabled in $(a^2bc,\emptyset)$ and no other evolution rule is.
    After this micro step we have $C = (ac,bc)$.
    Now we can apply rule R3, so we apply the evolution rule $r_1$ thus obtaining the partial configuration $C = (c,b^2c)$.
    No other evolution rule is enabled, so R1 is the only rule applicable, and we get 
    $C = (b^2c^2)$, and this is the configuration obtained after a whole computational step.
\end{example}

\section{Petri Net}

Here we define in a formal way what a Petri Net is.

\subsection{Petri Nets with Inhibitor Arcs}

Here we extend the latter definition of a Petri Net with the concept of inhibitor arcs.
